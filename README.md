# James-QiuHaoran.github.io

## Notice - Website Migration

This website james-qiuhaoran.github.io has been migrated and also updated to another website haoranqiu.web.illinois.edu. The old website has been serving for a long time until I went to UIUC.

I plan to keep the old website here in this repository and won't update anything any more. However, the website framework is free to use.

## Brief Intro

This is my personal website using bootstrap. The website URL is: https://james-qiuhaoran.github.io/index.html.

(You can also access my website from i.cs.hku.hk/~hrqiu employed on server in the CS Dept. of HKU.)

You can see my self-introduction, blogs, some experiences, footprint, social contacts and so on. WELCOME!!
